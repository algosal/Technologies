# Salman Saeed's Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Learning and Development Roadmap** repository! ðŸŽ¯ This repository documents my ambitious journey to master a diverse set of technologies, frameworks, and theoretical concepts across **programming**, **data science**, **AI development**, **full-stack development**, **automation**, **ethical hacking**, and **networking**.

## ðŸŒŸ **Roadmap Highlights**

### **Phase I: Foundations (2024 - Early 2025)**

- **Discrete Mathematics**: Logic, set theory, graph theory, recursion, and automata theory.
- **Express.js**: Backend development with routing, middleware, API creation, and authentication.
- **C#**: Desktop app development, LINQ, async programming, and OOP concepts.
- **Git Workflows**: Version control mastery, branching strategies, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Linux & Kali Linux**: Command-line proficiency, scripting, networking, and penetration testing.

### **Phase II: Core Technologies (Mid 2025)**

- **AWS VPC**: Mastering cloud networking, subnets, route tables, security, and automation.
- **Node.js**: Building scalable backend systems with Express.js and securing APIs.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure automation with IaC and AWS integration.
- **Kubernetes**: Advanced container orchestration, scaling, and networking.

### **Phase III: Advanced Skills (Late 2025 - 2026)**

- **Angular & Lumen**: Full-stack development using Angular for the frontend and Lumen for lightweight backend services.
- **C++**: Systems programming with STL, memory management, and multithreading.
- **Theory of Automata & Computation**: Exploring Turing machines, complexity theory, and computational models.
