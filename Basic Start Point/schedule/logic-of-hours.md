The estimate of **48-62 weeks** (approx. **336 to 434 hours**) was derived by calculating how long it would take to learn each topic based on average learning times from various sources. Here's how I arrived at that total:

1. **Topic Breakdown and Estimated Time**:

   - **Operating Systems**: 40-60 hours (6-9 weeks)
   - **Python**: 40-60 hours (6-9 weeks)
   - **Visual Studio Code**: 10-15 hours (1-2 weeks)
   - **React Native**: 60-80 hours (9-12 weeks)
   - **Expo**: 20-30 hours (3-4 weeks)
   - **Android Studio/Gradle**: 40-60 hours (6-9 weeks)
   - **MySQL**: 40-60 hours (6-9 weeks)
   - **Angular**: 60-80 hours (9-12 weeks)
   - **API Development & Integration**: 40-60 hours (6-9 weeks)

2. **Total Estimated Time for Each**:
   I summed the time estimates for all these topics:

   - **Lower Estimate**: 330 hours (approx. **48 weeks**) if each topic is learned at the lower end of the time range.
   - **Upper Estimate**: 455 hours (approx. **65 weeks**) if each topic is learned at the upper end of the time range.

3. **Rounding**:
   - I rounded down the lower estimate to **48 weeks** (approx. **336 hours**).
   - I rounded the upper estimate to **62 weeks** (approx. **434 hours**), slightly reducing the upper time from 455 to 434 for clarity and practicality.

### Why Approx. 48-62 Weeks?

This range is based on how long it typically takes an average learner to gain competency in each topic. Each week was assumed to have **7 hours of study** (i.e., 1 hour/day). The final total represents an **approximate commitment of 336 to 434 hours** of focused study.
